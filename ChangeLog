	  that pos is getting initialised in the next statement, but that
	  stopped dnscache from processing `cname' type records and thus
	  resolving names. It took me whole day to figure that out.
	  Anyway...lesson learned. :)

	* dnscache.c:
	  droproot.c:
	  pickdns.c:
	  rbldns.c:
	  tinydns.c:

	  str.h:
	  str_chr.c:
	  str_rchr.c: fixed the str_rchr() function to go from `end to start'
	  while looking for the given character.

	  All the above files are formatted as per the coding style
	  convenient to me. Also did add the copyright disclaimer at the top.

	  http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=104804013229536&w=2

	* error.h: patched to #include <errno.h> on Linux machines. Did add
	  copyright disclaimer at the top.

	* COPYING: changed to GPL version 2, instead of version 3.

	* dnscache.c: automatic local variable named `mode' renamed to `perm'
	  in couple of functions as there is already a global variable named
	  mode.

	* Hi, I take this source of original djbdns-1.05, as is, from

		http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html
	
	  and aim is to free it from the daemon of `daemontools', make it as
	  much independent & concise as possible and thus more usable and
	  maintainable.

	portability problem: on some buggy kernels, accept() fails to
		copy O_NONBLOCK. tnx Pavel Kankovsky. impact: with these
		kernels, dnscache hangs if a TCP connection times out.
		fix: ndelay_on() after accept().
	ui: dnscache discards non-recursive queries.
	ui: *-conf use envdir in */run.
	internal: reorganized seed_addtime() calls in dnscache-conf.
	ui: tinydns-data prohibits PTR in generic records.
20000917
	ui: dns_transmit_get() does not pause after most recv() errors.
		still pauses after connection-refused when udploop is 2.
	version: djbdns 1.01.
20000922
	portability problem: Linux distributions use bash as /bin/sh;
		bash destroys $UID. dorks. impact: dnscache and axfrdns
		run as root. fix: envdir, then sh, then envuidgid. but
		/bin/sh really has to stop polluting the environment.
20000923
	ui: install /etc/dnsroots.global. dnscache-conf tries
		dnsroots.local, then dnsroots.global.
	ui: no longer install home/etc/dnscache.
	version: djbdns 1.02.
20001224
	ui: new dnstrace output format.
	ui: dnstrace shows all servers providing each ns/a line.
	ui: added dnstracesort.
20001225
	internal: response_rstart() and response_cname() use uint32 ttl.
	internal: added response_hidettl().
	internal: cache_get() returns ttl.
	internal: dnscache keeps track of ttls for aliases.
	ui: dnscache returns ttl unless $HIDETTL is set.
	ui: dnscache returns ttl 655360 for localhost et al.
20001226
	ui: dnscache supports $FORWARDONLY. tnx to several people for
		the suggestion. tnx Dan Peterson for sample code.
	ui: dnscache now logs sequential query numbers, not indices.
	internal: revamped dnscache to separate udp from tcp.
	ui: dnscache reports uactive, tactive separately.
	ui: dnscache reports tcpopen/tcpclose by port and ip.
	ui: dnscache artificially times out oldest UDP query if UDP
		table is full, and oldest TCP connection if TCP table is
		full.
	ui: dnscache reports broken pipe when a TCP client sends FIN.
20001228
	ui: dnstrace supports dd.
	ui: dnscache logs stats when it handles 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.
	ui: pickdns actively refuses queries for unknown types.
	ui: pickdns responds to MX queries. tnx Mike Batchelor.
	internal: added const at various places.
	internal: removed some unused variables.
	internal: used time_t in tai_now.c.
	internal: used stdlib.h in alloc.c.
	api: split dns_domain_suffix() into suffix(), suffixpos().
	internal: switched to buffer_unix*.
	internal: included unistd.h for various declarations.
20010103
	ui: increased maximum data size from 512 bytes to 32767 bytes in
		tinydns, tinydns-get, axfrdns. allows big TXT records.
	ui: dnsmx reformats name when it prints an artificial 0 MX.
20010105
	ui: increased MAXLEVEL to 5. the Internet is becoming more
		glueless every day.
20010106
	version: djbdns 1.03.
20010113
	ui: increased MAXALIAS to 16.
	ui: dnscache no longer caches SERVFAIL. per-ip is obviously the
		way to go.
	ui: tinydns et al. now respond FORMERR to non-Internet-class
		queries.
	ui: tdlookup now returns A records in a random order in the
		answer section, and truncates the list after 8 records.
	ui: tinydns-data skips lines starting -.
20010114
	internal: documented the tinydns data.cdb format.
	ui: tinydns-data, tinydns, tinydns-get, axfrdns support client
		differentiation.
	ui: dnsqr aborts if it is given an extra argument.
20010117
	ui: dnstracesort removes duplicate lines.
	ui: dnstracesort prints glue.
	ui: dnstrace uses a ``start'' IP address for the root glue.
20010121
	version: djbdns 1.04.
20010206
	internal: response_query() takes a class argument.
	internal: query_start() takes a class argument.
	internal: packetquery() takes a class argument.
	ui: tinydns et al., axfrdns, and dnscache repeat qclass * in
		response to bogus * queries. tnx Mike Batchelor.
	ui: axfrdns rejects queries for weird classes.
	ui: axfrdns uses query ID instead of ID 0 in the series of AXFR
		response messages between the SOAs, to support the AXFR
		client in BIND 9.
	ui: axfrdns sets AA in the series of AXFR response messages.
20010211
	ui: servers print starting message.
	internal: some respond() declarations.
	version: djbdns 1.05.
