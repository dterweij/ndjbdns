                                   ==========


          Hello all,

               I am pleased to release this *new* djbdns version 1.06.
          Djbdns  is  a   fully-fledged   Domain   Name   System(DNS),
          originally  written  by the eminent author of qmail, Dr. D J
          Bernstein. This new release is a complete  makeover  to  the
          original source(djbdns-1.05) and is meant to make life a lot
          more pleasant. The original source is in public-domain since
          late Dec 2007.

              Please see: http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html

          Nevertheless,  this new release is distributed under the GNU
          General Public Licence for  good.  See  ChangeLog  for  more
          details.

          Installation:
          -------------

          To install djbdns, say:

               sh>$ ./configure [ --prefix=/usr/local ]
               sh>$ make
               sh># make install


          Once  installed,  On  Linux  machines  add `dnscache' to the
          system services by following steps. Note that, if you  chose
          a different install prefix with `--prefix', use that instead
          of the default - /usr/local.

               sh># mv /usr/local/bin/dnscached /etc/init.d/dnscached
               sh># chkconfig --add dnscached
               sh># chkconfig --list dnscached


          Now you can start the service by


               sh># service dnscached start
                        OR
               sh># dnscache -D


          Consult the dnscache(8) manual page for more help.


          Problems:
          ---------

               If you encounter any  problems  while  installing  New-
          DJBDNS  OR find bugs in its working, please send an email to
          <pj.pandit@yahoo.co.in>  describing  in  detail  about   the
          problem/bug.
