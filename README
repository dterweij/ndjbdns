                                 =============


          Hello all,

               I   am   pleased  to  release  this  *new*  version  of
          djbdns-1.05.4.  Djbdns  is  a  fully-fledged   Domain   Name
          System(DNS),  originally  written  by  the eminent author of
          qmail, Dr. D J Bernstein. This new  release  is  a  complete
          makeover to the original source(djbdns-1.05) and is meant to
          make life a lot more pleasant. The notable  changes  so  far
          are  in  the  set-up  &  configuration  steps.  The original
          source is in public-domain since late Dec 2007.

              Please see: http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html

          Nevertheless, this new release is distributed under the  GNU
          General  Public  Licence  for  good.  See ChangeLog for more
          details.

          Installation:
          -------------

          To install djbdns: just say

               sh>$ ./configure [ --prefix=/usr/local ]
               sh>$ make
               sh># make install


          Once installed, On Linux  machines  add  ‘dnscache’  to  the
          system  services by following steps. Note that, if you chose
          a different install prefix with ‘--prefix’, use that instead
          of the default - /usr/local.

               sh># mv /usr/local/bin/dnscached /etc/init.d/dnscached
               sh># chkconfig --add dnscached
               sh># chkconfig --list dnscached

          Now you can start the service by

               sh># service dnscached start
                        OR
               sh># dnscache -D


          Consult the dnscahce(1) manual page for more help.
